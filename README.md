# Project Overview

## Project Description

<!-- Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and/or functionality. -->

The purpose of this app is for users to be able to study efficiently on a specific subject they are having trouble or to brush up on old material. Users will have access to all default worksheets and the study cards in them. Once a worksheet is added to a user's workspace they will be able to create, delete and update the study cards in that particular worksheet.

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matix. 

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: |
| App Logic | 1 | 10hrs| 
| Database Setup | 2 | 1hrs| 
| Routes | 3 | 3hrs| 
| Page Layout | 4 | 8hrs| 
| Page Design | 5 | 9hrs|
| Total |  | 31hrs| 



## App Components

### Landing Page
<!-- What will a user see when they start your app? -->
A user will see a welcome page that give them tips and tricks on how to be a better learner.

### App Initialization
<!-- What will a user see when the app is started?  -->
When the app is started users will be able to view all worksheets on the site, or they can navigate to the tutorial page that explains all actions they can do with the worksheets.

### Using The App
<!-- What will be the flow of the game, what will the user be expected to do and what will the user expect from the game. -->
Once the user has chosen a worksheet they can choose what type of questions they want. The types of questions available will be multiple choice, short answer and essay questions. They can choose a combination of the types or choose all of them. Users will also be able to edit their workspace by creating a new study card, or updating or deleting a study card that's already available.


## MVP 

<!-- Include the full list of features that will be part of your MVP  -->
- 1 player game
- User will be greeted by name.
- Cards will be animated to move across the screen.
- Cards can be clicked to another card, if the rank of the card being clicked on is one rank lower than the card it's being placed on.
- Score will be determined by time.
- Creating the design of each card based on the suit the user has chosen.

## POST MVP

<!-- Include the full list of features that you are considering for POST MVP -->
- Users will have to log in to edit their workspace
- Logged in users will be able to create their own worksheets

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous game phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility.  Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method. 

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. 

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Game Logic | 1 | 7hrs| 12hrs | 12hrs |
| Card Animation | 2 | 4hrs| 2hrs | 2hrs |
| Suits Creation | 3 | 3hrs| 3hrs | 3hrs |
| Page Layout | 4 | 6hrs| 7hrs | 8hrs |
| Game Score | 5 | 1hrs| 1hrs | 2hrs |
| Post-MVP | 6 | 10hrs| 1hrs | 1hrs |
| Total |  | 31hrs| 26hrs | 29hrs |
